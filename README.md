# API_Python_Java

## Introduction
My main programming language is Python, which I have been using extensively since 2017. In addition, I worked with Java between 2017 and 2020, gaining valuable experience in its robust and structured approach to development. As part of this project I wanted to work on the API concept, so I started with a python script and after that I continued but with a java project with the maven project manager.

## REST Framework
The REST (Representational State Transfer) framework is an architectural style for designing web services. It relies on simple principles, such as using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources identified by URLs. Data exchange typically occurs in lightweight formats like JSON or XML, following a stateless model where each request contains all the necessary information, without relying on server-side state.

## Python 
I use the Flask library because it is lightweight, flexible, and easy to set up, making it ideal for building REST frameworks. Its simplicity allows developers to quickly create endpoints, while its extensibility supports the addition of tools like authentication or database integration as needed. Flask's strong community and rich ecosystem of plugins further streamline the development of scalable APIs.

## Java
For Java, I use the Maven project manager to streamline dependency management and build processes, ensuring efficient and organized development. To create REST APIs, I rely on the Spring Framework, which provides powerful tools like Spring Boot for rapid application setup and Spring MVC for building robust and scalable RESTful services. This combination allows for clean, modular, and maintainable code, perfectly suited for enterprise-grade applications.

## Postman
To make and test API requests, I use Postman, a versatile tool designed for building, testing, and documenting APIs. It allows me to easily configure and send requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), inspect responses, and debug any issues in real-time. With its user-friendly interface and powerful features like collections and automated testing, Postman streamlines the development and validation of REST APIs.
